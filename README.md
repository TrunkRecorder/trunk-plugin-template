# Trunk Recorder Lite plugin template

A starting point for a [Trunk Recorder Lite](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-recorder-lite)
plugin in Rust: a working example plugin, tests, CI, and a release workflow
that builds for every platform the recorder runs on.

A plugin is a small program of its own. The recorder starts it, tells it what
happens (a call starts, a recorded call lands on disk, a radio registers, …),
and stops it. Plugins watch; they don't change what gets recorded. Uploaders
(OpenMHz, Broadcastify), streamers, loggers and notifiers are all plugins.

The example here, **call-log**, writes a line of JSON for every recorded call.
For complete plugins built from this template, see the
[OpenMHz](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-openmhz),
[Broadcastify](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-broadcastify) and
[Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-rdioscanner)
uploaders, [simplestream](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-simplestream)
(live audio) and [upload-script](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-upload-script).

## Quick start

1. **Use this template** on GitHub (or copy it) to make your plugin's repository.
2. In `Cargo.toml`, set `name` (your plugin's id), `description`, `repository`
   and `authors`. In `src/main.rs`, set the display `name` in `manifest()`.
   Delete `docs/` (it stays here, up to date) and rewrite this README for your
   plugin's users. [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md#2-name-your-plugin)
   has the full list.
3. Build and look at what the recorder will see:
   ```sh
   cargo build
   ./target/debug/call-log --describe
   ```
4. Run it against calls you've already recorded:
   ```sh
   trunk-lite plugin run ./target/debug/call-log ~/TrunkRecorderLite --limit 5
   ```
5. Replace the example with your plugin, and keep the tests passing:
   `cargo test`.
6. Tag a release (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`); the workflow builds it
   for Linux, macOS and Windows. Then [submit it to the registry](docs/registry.md).
