# The plugin registry

> The recorder's plugin store, on its **Plugins** page (and `trunk-pro plugin
> search | install | update`), installs from this registry. It's in the
> recorder's next release; until then, install a plugin by hand: unpack its
> release into the plugins folder (below), or add its executable with **Add
> from a file** on that page.

The registry is a GitHub repository, [`TrunkRecorder/plugins`](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/plugins), listing the
plugins the recorder's plugin store offers. Each entry pins an exact release
of a plugin by checksum. The recorder installs only files that match, so what
users get is what was reviewed.

## An entry

Each plugin has a file, `plugins/<id>.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "openmhz",
  "name": "OpenMHz",
  "description": "Uploads recorded calls to OpenMHz.",
  "repository": "https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-openmhz",
  "homepage": "https://openmhz.com",
  "license": "GPL-3.0-or-later",
  "tier": "official",
  "version": "0.1.1",
  "api": 1,
  "tag": "v0.1.1",
  "commit": "669ea2d10b193728b82276ec9ed77c81118f164f",
  "assets": {
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": {
      "url": "https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/trunk-plugin-openmhz/releases/download/v0.1.1/openmhz-0.1.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz",
      "sha256": "74c54539…"
    },
    "aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu": { "url": "…", "sha256": "…" },
    "universal-apple-darwin": { "url": "…", "sha256": "…" },
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": { "url": "…", "sha256": "…" }
  }
}
```

`tier` is `official` for plugins maintained with the recorder, and `community`
for everyone else's. The store shows the difference.

`commit` is the commit the tag pointed at when the entry was added: a tag can
be moved, so the commit records which source was reviewed.

You don't write an entry by hand. The registry's `add-release` script writes
it from your release's manifest and `SHA256SUMS`.

## Getting listed

1. Release your plugin with the template's release workflow (see
   [Releasing](releasing.md)).
2. Open a pull request on the registry that adds `plugins/<id>.json`. Run the
   registry's `add-release` script to write it, then `check` to check it:
   `./add-release https://github.com/you/trunk-plugin-pager v0.1.0`.
3. CI checks every file's checksum and build provenance, and runs the Linux
   build's `--describe`. A maintainer reviews the rest.

The registry's [README](https://github.com/TrunkRecorder/plugins#readme) has
the details.

What review looks for:

- **The source is public**, and the release was built from it by GitHub
  Actions, not uploaded from someone's computer. The release workflow's
  provenance attestations show this (see [Releasing](releasing.md)).
- **It does what it says**, and nothing else. In particular, it sends no data
  anywhere the user didn't configure.
- **Secrets are marked** `x-secret`, and never logged.
- **It copes with missing M4A** if it asks for M4A (see [Audio](audio.md)).
- **It starts with its default settings**, or explains in `start` what to set.
- **It's licensed**, and the id isn't taken.

## Updating

Release the new version, then open a pull request that updates your entry's
entry. `add-release` writes it.

The store shows **Update available** when the registry has a newer version
than the one installed. Users update when they choose. Settings carry over.

## How the recorder installs a plugin

1. It downloads the archive for its platform from the entry's `url`.
2. It checks the archive's SHA-256 against the entry, and stops if they differ.
3. It unpacks the archive into `plugins/<id>/` in its config folder (next to
   `config.json`).
4. It runs `<id> --describe`, and checks that the id matches the entry and that
   it supports the plugin's `api`.
5. It shows the plugin's settings form, and the user turns it on.

The recorder ships with a copy of the registry, so the store works offline.
It fetches the latest registry when the store is opened.

## Unlisted plugins

A plugin doesn't have to be in the registry to run. The store can install one
from a GitHub release URL, with a warning that nobody has reviewed it. And for
development, **Add from a file** on the Plugins page runs any executable. See
[Getting started](getting-started.md#6-run-it-inside-your-recorder).
